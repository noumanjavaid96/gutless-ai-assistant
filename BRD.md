Gutless AI Slack Assistant: POC/MVP - Modules & Business Requirements Document 
 This document outlines the key modules and business requirements for the Proof of Concept (POC) / Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Gutless AI Slack Assistant. The initial focus is on utilizing content exclusively from Week 1  of the Gutless program. 
 I. Key Modules for the POC/MVP 
 Here are the main components that will work together to bring the Gutless AI Assistant to life: 
 Content Ingestion & Processing Module: 
 Video Transcriber:  Converts Week 1 Zoom coaching call recordings into text. 
 Tooling:  Whisper or ODIN. 
 Transcript Segmenter & Cleaner:  Divides the raw transcripts into manageable 2-5 minute chunks and performs basic cleanup (e.g., removing excessive filler words if desired). 
 Metadata Attacher:  Tags each text chunk with essential metadata, including the source video ID and the precise start/end timestamps. This is crucial for linking back to the video. 
 PDF Content Extractor/Linker:  Identifies and makes accessible the content of Week 1 PDFs, or stores direct links to them for suggestion. 
 Embedding & Vector Storage Module: 
 Embedding Generator:  Uses OpenAI's embedding models to convert the textual content (transcript chunks, potentially PDF content summaries) into numerical vector representations. 
 Vector Database (Pinecone):  Stores these vectors along with their associated metadata (timestamps, source info) in Pinecone, enabling fast and efficient similarity searches. 
 Slack Bot Interface Module (The "Face" of the Assistant): 
 Message Receiver:  Captures client questions posted in designated Slack channels or direct messages to the bot. 
 Response Formatter & Sender:  Takes the generated answer and formats it clearly for Slack, including the natural language summary, video timestamp link, and PDF link (if applicable). Posts the response back to the client. 
 Slack API Integrator:  Handles all communication with the Slack API (using Slack Bolt for Python, as preferred), including authentication, permissions, and interactive elements if any. 
 Core Logic & Orchestration Module (The "Brain"): 
 Query Processor:  Analyzes the client's question to understand intent. 
 Vector Search Executor:  Converts the client's question into an embedding and queries the Pinecone vector database to find the most relevant text chunks from the Week 1 content. 
 Context Assembler:  Gathers the top N relevant chunks to provide context for answer generation. 
 Answer Synthesizer (GPT-4):  Feeds the client's question and the retrieved context chunks to GPT-4 to generate a concise, natural-language answer. 
 Information Linker:  Ensures the correct video URL with the precise timestamp and any relevant PDF links are packaged with the answer. 
 Orchestration Tooling:  LangChain or LlamaIndex to manage the flow between components. 
 Logging Module (Optional but Recommended for POC): 
 Q&A Recorder:  Logs client questions and the bot's responses (including sources used). 
 Tooling:  Google Sheets API or Notion API for simple logging. This helps in monitoring performance and identifying areas for improvement. 
 Configuration Management Module: 
 Secure Credential Storage:  Manages API keys (OpenAI, Pinecone, Slack), model parameters, video source details (e.g., Unlisted YouTube links for Week 1), and paths/links to PDF resources. 
 II. Business Requirements Document (BRD) - POC/MVP (Week 1 Focus) 
 1. Introduction & Executive Summary 
 Project Title:  Gutless AI Slack Assistant - POC/MVP (Week 1 Content). 
 Client:  Bryce Anderson | Brand: Gutless. 
 Project Overview:  This initiative is to develop a Proof of Concept (POC) / Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for an AI-powered assistant integrated into Slack. The primary function of this assistant is to answer client questions related to Week 1 of the Gutless coaching program by leveraging transcribed video content and associated PDF resources. The system will utilize GPT-4 for natural language understanding and response generation, and Pinecone for efficient information retrieval via vector search. 
 Business Need:  To provide timely and accurate support to Gutless clients for Week 1 queries, reduce the repetitive question-answering load on human coaches, enhance client engagement and satisfaction, and validate the technical feasibility and business value of a scalable AI coaching assistant. 
 2. Business Objectives 
 BO1:  Validate the ability of an AI assistant to accurately answer 80-90% of common client questions pertaining to Week 1 content. 
 BO2:  Reduce the time spent by human coaches on answering repetitive Week 1 questions. 
 BO3:  Improve client experience by providing instant, 24/7 access to information from Week 1 materials within Slack. 
 BO4:  Efficiently leverage existing Week 1 video transcripts and PDF resources. 
 BO5:  Establish a modular technical foundation that can be scaled to include content from subsequent program weeks and potentially be offered to other coaching businesses. 
 3. Project Scope (POC/MVP - Week 1 Focus) 
 In Scope: 
 Transcription of provided Week 1 Gutless Zoom coaching video(s). 
 Automated chunking of transcripts into 2-5 minute segments with accurate timestamp metadata. 
 Generation of text embeddings for transcript chunks using OpenAI models. 
 Storage and indexing of embeddings and metadata in a Pinecone vector database. 
 Development of a Slack bot (Python using Slack Bolt preferred) that: 
 Receives client questions related to Week 1 content. 
 Queries the Pinecone database for relevant information. 
 Uses GPT-4 to generate a concise, natural-language summary answer. 
 Provides a direct link to the specific timestamp in the Week 1 video (hosted on Unlisted YouTube). 
 Suggests/links to a relevant Week 1 PDF if applicable. 
 Basic logging of questions and answers (e.g., to Google Sheets or Notion - optional). 
 Deployment for testing within a designated Slack workspace. 
 Focus exclusively on content from "Week 1 only" of the Gutless program. 
 Out of Scope (for this POC/MVP): 
 Content from Gu
